    - Bug fix: when wine is deleted in WineDetails, it still shows up in wine table.
      Deleted wine disappears once a different page is loaded.
    - Show wine type with the background color of the row?
    - Implement filters: only show red wines, wines with volume = 0.75, etc.
    - Use v-chip to present active filters?
